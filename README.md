chanchan
========

Chanchan is a lightweight static blog generator written in clojure.  It's intended to be a replacement for something like [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

The initial goal is to be able to generate a very simple blog such as [this](http://gmacd.github.io).

It currently makes use of [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/).
